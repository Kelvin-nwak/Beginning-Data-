## Project Overview

This project aims to conduct a comprehensive data analysis of two retail stores, Computech and Microworld. The objective is to compare their sales performance and other relevant metrics to derive insights and actionable recommendations. This analysis will help identify strengths and weaknesses, uncover trends, and support strategic decision-making for both stores.

  ### Data Cleaning/Preparations

  in the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
  1. Data loading and inspection.
  2. Handling missing values.
  3. Data cleaning and formatting.
 
### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

- what is the overall sales by store?
-  what are the overall sales by manager?
-  what are the overall sales by month?
-  what are the overall sales by category?

### Data Analysis

Include some basic Excel functions 
- find and replace function 
- pivot table
- charts and graphs 


### Result/Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. Between the two stores computech generates more sales thand microworld
2. Memory cards are the best-performing category in terms of sales and revenue.
3. the month of april has the highest sales for both computech and microworld while june is the mothe with the lowest sales for the both stores

  ### Limitation

I had to remove all zero values from budget and revenue columns because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis. There are still a few outliers even after the omissions but even then we can still see that there is a positive correlation between both budget and number of votes with revenue.
